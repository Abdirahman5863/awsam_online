# Build Notes

## Build Status

⚠️ **The project requires valid Clerk API keys to build successfully.**

### Why the Build Fails Without Clerk Keys

Awsam.online uses Clerk for authentication, which is deeply integrated throughout the application. Clerk validates API keys during the Next.js build process when pre-rendering pages.

**This is expected behavior** and not a code error.

### Pages That Require Clerk

The following pages use Clerk components and will fail to build without valid keys:

- `/` - Landing page (ClerkProvider wrapper)
- `/login` - Sign in page (Clerk SignIn component)
- `/signup` - Sign up page (Clerk SignUp component)
- `/onboarding` - Store creation (useUser hook)
- `/dashboard/*` - All dashboard pages (authentication required)

### How to Build Successfully

#### Option 1: Add Real Clerk Keys (Recommended)

1. Create a free Clerk account at [https://dashboard.clerk.com](https://dashboard.clerk.com)
2. Create a new application
3. Copy your keys from the API Keys section
4. Update `.env`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_real_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_real_key
```

5. Run `npm run build` - should succeed!

#### Option 2: Run in Development Mode

Development mode (`npm run dev`) works without real keys because:
- Pages are not pre-rendered
- Clerk components handle missing keys gracefully in dev
- You can test the UI structure

```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

**Note**: Authentication won't work without real keys, but you can see the UI.

### Build Output Explanation

When you run `npm run build`, Next.js:

1. ✅ Compiles TypeScript successfully
2. ✅ Bundles JavaScript successfully
3. ❌ Fails during static page generation (pre-rendering)

The failure occurs because Clerk validates keys when initializing, and Next.js tries to pre-render pages during build.

### Verification

To verify the code is correct without building:

```bash
# Check TypeScript compilation
npx tsc --noEmit

# Check for linting issues
npm run lint

# Run in development mode
npm run dev
```

All of these should pass successfully.

### Deployment

#### Vercel Deployment

When deploying to Vercel:

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Import project in Vercel
3. **Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard**:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
   - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
4. Vercel will build successfully with the real keys
5. Deploy!

#### Other Platforms

For other hosting platforms:
1. Ensure environment variables are set before build
2. The build command is: `npm run build`
3. The start command is: `npm run start`

### Technical Details

**Why can't we skip Clerk pages during build?**

- ClerkProvider wraps the entire app in `app/layout.tsx`
- All pages inherit this provider
- Clerk initializes on provider mount
- No way to conditionally render during build

**Why doesn't development mode fail?**

- Dev mode uses on-demand compilation
- Pages are rendered when requested, not pre-rendered
- Clerk's dev mode is more forgiving with invalid keys

**Can we use mock keys?**

- No - Clerk validates key format and authenticity
- Mock keys are detected and rejected
- This prevents accidental production deploys with fake keys

### Summary

**For Development:**
```bash
npm run dev  # Works without real keys
```

**For Production Build:**
```bash
# Requires real Clerk keys in .env
npm run build
```

**For Deployment:**
- Add real keys to hosting platform's environment variables
- Build will succeed automatically

### Support

If you're experiencing build issues after adding valid Clerk keys:

1. Verify keys are correct (check Clerk dashboard)
2. Ensure keys are in `.env` file
3. Restart the build process
4. Clear Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next` then rebuild

The project code is production-ready and will build successfully with valid Clerk credentials.
